As my generic tagline states, I'm a husband, father, mountain biker, DevOps /
networking guy, gamer, and generic geek.  I'm a Bermudian born and raised, and
am currently working as an IaaS / DevOps / Network Engineer at a cloud and data
centre provider.  Check out the social icons below for more of my stuff.
