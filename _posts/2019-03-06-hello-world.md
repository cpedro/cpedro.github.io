title: "Welcome to my little corner of the web!"
---

In the past, I've never been much for "blogging" or anything like that.  But
I've always kinda liked the idea of having my own little web space.  What
really started as wanting a place to link to my social media turned into
something bigger.

Originally I started on the very shady looking site, linktr.ee, which I would
***not*** recommend.  Who knows what sort of crap they were tracking, especially
since it tied into an Instagram account.

That's when I stumbled across [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  I've
been using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for quite some time, and so have been
geting fairly comfortable with Markdown.  Getting proficient with Markdown
really came when I started taking personal and meeting notes in Markdown, and
even writing quite and dirty documentation with it.  When I found that I could
take Markdown and some barebones HTML and turn it into a nice looking website
with a simple "push" command, I feel down a deep rabbit hole and haven't come
back up yet.  (Kinda like listening to K-pop I'm told!)

So feel free to visit every once and while.  I find myself coming back to this
little project from time to time, and it has really grown past just having a
simple landing page for myself.  I don't promise to be entertaining or regular
with posts, but who knows?
